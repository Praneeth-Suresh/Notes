# Agent Rules

## Before Coding

1. Read `agent/task-routing.md`, classify the task, and load only the matching workflow skill.
2. Read the minimum relevant canonical files in `agent/` requested by that workflow.
3. Identify the bounded context and intended public interface.
4. For feature implementation, confirm a user-ratified plan exists. If not, plan first and stop.
5. For non-trivial or ambiguous work, run `grill-me` locally.
6. Run `interview-me` only when `grill-me` leaves an unresolved user-judgment question.
7. Choose the smallest deterministic check that can prove behavior.
8. Use `agent/session-state.md` only for temporary, session-specific implementation state.

## While Coding

1. Work in one internal feature slice at a time.
2. Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
3. Define types/interfaces before implementation where possible.
4. Keep public interfaces small; hide detail behind boundaries.
5. Do not reach into another bounded context's internals.
6. Do not weaken tests to pass implementation.
7. For web app or HTML/CSS tasks, use Microsoft Playwright MCP for browser verification instead of screenshot-only assumptions.
8. Do not use sub-agents unless the user explicitly asks for them.
9. Do not expose feature-slice bookkeeping to the user.

## Before Finishing

1. Run `./scripts/check.sh`.
2. Run any task-specific checks defined in `agent/testing-policy.md`.
3. Update glossary/design tree/architecture/ADRs if durable design changed.
4. Clear `agent/session-state.md` when temporary implementation state is no longer needed.
5. Clear resolved session error history after debugging succeeds.

## Final Response Contract

Final response must include:

- What changed.
- Which checks ran.
- Which checks were skipped or unavailable.
- Whether tests changed.
- Whether `tests/.manifest.sha256` changed.
- Which skill(s) were used.
- Whether temporary session state was cleared or why it remains.
