# Adding Features

## Purpose

Implement approved feature work one internal feature slice at a time.

## Required Gate

Feature implementation requires an approved plan.

- If no approved plan exists, run the planning workflow first and stop after presenting the plan.
- Do not edit implementation code until the user ratifies the plan.
- After ratification, implement only the next internal feature slice.

## Process

1. Confirm the approved plan or produce one if missing.
2. Load only the relevant canonical files:
   - `agent/project-brief.md`
   - `agent/design-tree.md`
   - `agent/architecture.md`
   - `agent/ubiquitous-language.md`
   - `agent/testing-policy.md`
   - `agent/agent-rules.md`
3. If the feature needs multiple implementation steps or may be interrupted, create or update `agent/session-state.md` with the smallest internal feature-slice checklist.
4. Select exactly one internal feature slice before coding.
5. Run `testing-vertical-slices` to choose the smallest useful test/check.
6. Implement the selected slice behind the intended public interface.
7. Run the formatter command, narrow checks, then the broader project check.
8. Update `agent/session-state.md` only if more work remains or the slice is blocked.
9. Clear `agent/session-state.md` when the feature is complete.
10. Update glossary, architecture, design tree, or ADRs only when durable design knowledge changed.

## Rules

- Do not expose feature-slice bookkeeping to the user.
- Do not store session-specific slice state in canonical files.
- Do not start a second slice in the same pass unless the approved plan and checks make it safe.
- Do not weaken tests to make implementation pass.
- If tests change intentionally, update the test manifest and explain why.
- Do not use sub-agents unless the user explicitly asks for them.

## Temporary Vs Durable State

Temporary state belongs in `agent/session-state.md` and must be cleared when no longer needed:

- internal feature slices
- current blocked/resume note
- failing command excerpts
- scratch reviewer notes

Durable state belongs in canonical files only when it changes future work:

- bounded context ownership
- public interfaces
- adapter contracts
- domain terminology
- settled architectural tradeoffs
- test strategy

## Final Response

- What was implemented or plan awaiting approval
- Files changed
- Checks run
- Checks skipped or unavailable
- Whether tests changed
- Whether the test manifest changed
- Design files or ADRs updated
- Whether temporary session state was cleared or why it remains
